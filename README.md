### Project

A question-answer web-app which saves a users iteration title and questionnaire answers per iteration.

The main overview page shows the overview of all iterations, finished and incomplete, with the option of viewing the results as well. From this page, user is able to start a new iteration or delete existing iterations. 

### Information

Which CRUD functions could be used?

Create - used when creating new iteration and corresponding information, including status of iteration, date, etc

Read - used for overview displays, as well as a possible api for questionnaire

Update - could be potentially used if "not completed" iterations would be "in progress" and user would be given the option to continue where they left off, or if completed questionnaires could be changed. Overview page information would be updated.

Delete - for any delete operations
